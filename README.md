# Server-Side-APIs-Weather-Dashboard

# Description

The OpenWeather One Call API to retrieve and display weather data for cities.

# Planning Notes:

refer to this website for notes 2-4: https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/apis/how-to-use-api-keys

1.  Create HTML and CSS general styling and structure before including the JS elements.
2.  Link the Weather Data APIs into variables in the js (APIKey, APICallCity etc.). Create click event for the users city input.
3.  Contruct a query URL and save into a variable queryURL.
4.  Impliment into an API call using Fetch - fetch(queryURL)
5.  Save the searched locations to local storage and have listed below the search bar for ease of user access.
    Bonus: Include in the users location to pull the info without them searching.
